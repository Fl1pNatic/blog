title:  How's Clickaformer?
---

<i>Honestly, to me, publicly announcing anything related to Clickaformer is like a joke at this point</i>

It has been in development for over a year at this point, and it's still nowhere near release. But, I am actually making some progress on it for once, and I wanted to share it.

## Completely remade
The project was started somewhere in February 2022, but the current iteration was started in late December 2022. I mostly didn't like how a lot of things were made in the original. The player movement script was a complete joke as well. I felt like I could do better, considering I got a lot of programming, and gamedev experience throughout the year, and I did. 

Throughout the post I will refer to the original version as v1 and to the current version as v2 for simplicity's sake.

## It's got style
I never noticed it until it was too late but I kind of started to develop an artstyle for it as well. It's mostly just 2 colors per sprite, with most being black and white, allowing me to kind of make them all the same style.

One thing that breaks that are the buttons. I made their outlines shift hue, and I think it looks better. I couldn't really decide on the exact color, and I think the buttons are the most important objects, so, giving them a recognizable outline sounded good to me.

Overall, it's really simplistic, and doesn't require me to do TOO much drawing (which I suck at). Yet, I still feel like it is unique from other games, especially when combined with the level design.


## Level making
For v1 I first just manually placed rectangles, then I started using tilemaps for ground and walls.

Nothing really changed from there, I use a tilemap to map out the solid geometry like ground and walls. Then I manually place things like spikes, buttons, platforms, etc.

Levels are mostly enclosed areas, with pits, in which the player can fall, and most of the times die.

## Other stuff
<i>This is a section dedicated to smaller things in no particular order</i>

- The player movement is remade using the new input system, and I made it feel less floaty then v1.
- I added some small lore snippets in every level.

## Conclusion
I am making progress. Slowly, but surely. It's honestly a nice break from working on [Cube](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2266090/Cube/), because I am the only dev and I can really just make whatever game I want to.

Hopefully, one day I will release Clickaformer, and I hope, it's gonna be something I am proud of.
